**BrainStation Cybersecurity Program - Capstone Project**

---

## Project Overview
This capstone project focuses on a case study which outlines the Cybersecurity challenges faced by **ShopEverything**, a large retail and e-commerce company. As part of the BrainStation Cybersecurity Program and final project, this involved identifying vulnerabilities, analyzing risks, and proposing actionable solutions to enhance the companyâ€™s security posture. The solutions were presented to the class in a Presentation (see Cybersecurity Presentation: Retail Summarised). 

---

## Key Objectives
- Perform a **risk assessment** using the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**.
- Analyze a **phishing attack** and its impact on sensitive data and critical systems.
- Develop a comprehensive **Incident Response Plan (IRP)** and **Crisis Communication Plan**.
- Address risks associated with **third-party vendors** and **insider threats**.
- Recommend security improvements to mitigate future incidents.

---

## Key Highlights

### **1. Risk Assessment & Analysis**
- Identified vulnerabilities in:
  - **Phishing attacks** due to lack of employee training.
  - **Unencrypted sensitive data** (PII and payment details).
  - **Weak password policies** and absence of **multi-factor authentication (MFA)**.
  - **Vendor risks** from excessive data sharing without proper controls.
  - See Risk Register in Presentation

### **2. Solutions & Recommendations**
- **Encrypt Data**: Protect sensitive customer information at rest and in transit.
- **Access Control**: Implement MFA and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Deploy SIEM and IDS/IPS for continuous threat detection.
- **Employee Training**: Conduct cybersecurity awareness programs and phishing simulations.
- **Zero Trust Architecture**: Adopt a Zero Trust model to minimize lateral movement.
- **Incident Response Plan**: Develop a formal IRP to ensure swift detection, containment, and communication during incidents.

### **3. NIST Cybersecurity Framework Alignment**
- **Identify**: Asset inventory and risk mapping.
- **Protect**: Encryption, MFA, and security training.
- **Detect**: SIEM, IDS/IPS for real-time monitoring.
- **Respond**: Formal Incident Response Plan.
- **Recover**: Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity Plans.

## Tools & Skills Used
- **Frameworks**: NIST Cybersecurity Framework  
- **Tools Suggested**: SIEM, IDS/IPS, Encryption  
- **Concepts**: Incident Response, Risk Management, Phishing Prevention, Zero Trust Architecture  

---

## Lessons Learned
- The importance of **proactive security measures**, such as encryption and employee training.  
- The value of **vendor risk management** and limiting third-party data access.  
- How adopting industry best practices (e.g., Zero Trust Architecture) reduces vulnerabilities.
